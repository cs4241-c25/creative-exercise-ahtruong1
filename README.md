# Squid Game Card
Squid Game is a popular Korean series on Netflix where contestants participate in deadly kid games for a hefty cash prize. In the series, contestants receive an invitation in the form of a card. The card contains a circle, triangle, and a square. For my project, I recreated the business card, decorating it with the colors associated with Squid Game.
